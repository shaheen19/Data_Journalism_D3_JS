          <h2>Correlations between Health Risks, Age, and Income</h2>
          <p>In this assignment various correlations such as obesity, smoking, lack of health care were explored with the household income in the United States. The data indicate inverse trend between obesity and household income (R-squared = 0.424, Fig. 1), meaning that people with the higher income tend to maintain good health. This trend may be due to good eating habits, and regualr exercise. However, the higher obesity with low income may translate to lack of good food and recreational facility in those areas. High smoking rates with R-squared (0.436) in low income populations is baffeling as harmful effects of smoke are widely known and even written warning is provided on each pack of cigratte. Statistical analysis is found in folder named Figures in assets directory.
          A weak negative (inverse) corrleation with R-squared (0.188) between household income and lack of health care is obvious as poor families lack resources to invest in good health care program. It is worth emphasizing that people with low income should avoid smoking and invest in good eating habits and guide their own families towards healthy living.</p>

          <p>No signficant correlation was observed between age, smoking, and obesity (Fig.2). A slight negative trend was observed between age and health care, which may  be due to the fact that yonger individual tend to be healthy and avoid extra cost of medical insurance. Individuals above the age of 35 tend to purchase health care insurances.</p>

          <p>A positive correaltion (R squared = 0.27) of poverty with obesity, smoking and lack of health care reinforces the previous conclusion. Indeed, the household income and poverty are somewhat related parameters. However, statistically, these correlations are poor and require big data set with multiple years of observatons to draw solid conclusions.</p>
